# File Iteration Log

## Files Modified/Created

### Phase 0 - Installation & Setup
| File | Change | Integration Note |
|------|--------|------------------|
| `requirements.txt` | Updated with minimal deps | Core dependencies only |
| `scripts/install_models.sh` | Created ONNX installer | Unix/Linux model setup |
| `scripts/install_models.ps1` | Created PS installer | Windows model setup |
| `src/her/models/MODEL_INFO.json` | Generated by installer | Model metadata |

### Phase 1 - Component Documentation
| File | Change | Integration Note |
|------|--------|------------------|
| `COMPONENTS_MATRIX.md` | Created component inventory | Framework architecture |

### Phase 2 - Test Harness
| File | Change | Integration Note |
|------|--------|------------------|
| `functional_harness/products/*` | Created product fixtures | Disambiguation tests |
| `functional_harness/forms/*` | Created form fixtures | Field selection tests |
| `functional_harness/spa/*` | Created SPA fixtures | Route change tests |

### Phase 3 - Validation Runner
| File | Change | Integration Note |
|------|--------|------------------|
| `scripts/run_functional_validation.py` | Created E2E runner | Validates against ground truth |
| `src/her/mock_client.py` | Created mock client | Testing without full stack |

### Phase 4 - Scoring Documentation
| File | Change | Integration Note |
|------|--------|------------------|
| `SCORING_NOTES.md` | Documented scoring system | Fusion weights and features |

## Import Safety Checks

### Verified Compilations
```bash
$ python3 -m compileall src
# ✅ All files compile without syntax errors
```

### Import Chain Validation
- `her.cli_api` → `her.pipeline` → `her.rank.fusion` ✅
- `her.embeddings._resolve` → filesystem only ✅
- `her.cache.two_tier` → sqlite3 + collections ✅
- No circular imports detected ✅

## Public Contract Updates

### CLI API Contract
- `HybridClient.query(phrase, url)` → Returns strict JSON
- `HybridClient.act(step, url)` → Returns action result
- All outputs include `waits`, `frame`, `post_action` blocks

### Pipeline Config
- Added flags for all features (SPA, resilience, etc.)
- Backward compatible with defaults

## Test Coverage Impact

### New Test Categories
- Functional validation via fixtures
- Ground truth comparison
- Latency measurements (cold vs warm)
- Cache hit rate tracking

## Build & Package Verification

```bash
$ python3 -m build
# ✅ Package builds successfully

$ pip install dist/*.whl
# ✅ Installation works

$ python3 -c "from her import HERPipeline"
# ✅ Imports resolve
```

## CI/CD Updates Required

### GitHub Actions
- Add `scripts/install_models.sh` to CI setup
- Run `scripts/run_functional_validation.py` in test phase
- Ensure Playwright browsers installed

### Environment Variables
- `HER_MODELS_DIR` - Optional model directory override
- `HER_CACHE_DIR` - Optional cache location

## Performance Impact

### Measured Latencies
- Cold start: ~103ms (with mock client)
- Warm cache: ~3.4ms (30x improvement)
- Cache hit rate: ~60% on test fixtures

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Accuracy Below Target**
   - Current: 60%
   - Target: ≥95%
   - Need scoring improvements

2. **Missing Fixtures**
   - Frames/shadow DOM
   - Large DOM stress test
   - i18n/a11y tests

3. **Real Client Integration**
   - Mock client used for testing
   - Need full pipeline validation

## Next Steps

1. Implement scoring improvements
2. Add remaining fixtures
3. Integrate real HER client
4. Run full validation suite
5. Achieve ≥95% accuracy target
