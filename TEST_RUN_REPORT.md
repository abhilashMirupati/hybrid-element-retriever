# Test Run Report

## Initial Test Execution

**Date**: 2024  
**Command**: `pytest -q --maxfail=10 --disable-warnings --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`

## Summary

- **Tests Collected**: 248
- **Collection Errors**: 10
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED - Multiple import and collection errors

## Error Categories

### 1. Import Errors (70%)
- Missing modules that were archived: `her.pipeline_v2`, `her.scoring.fusion_scorer_v2`
- Incorrect class names: `FusionScorer` not found in `her.rank.fusion`
- These are due to the reorganization removing versioned files

### 2. Runtime Errors (20%)
- `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'element'` in test files
- Tests have code outside functions that runs during collection

### 3. Configuration Errors (10%)
- `'benchmark' not found in markers` - Missing pytest configuration

## Successful Tests

Despite errors, some tests do run successfully:
- `test_basic.py`: 4/4 tests pass ✅
- `test_descriptors.py`: 6/6 tests pass ✅
- Basic functionality is working

## Performance Metrics

Not available due to test failures. Will be captured after fixes.

## NLP Scoring Accuracy

Not available due to import errors. Will be measured after fixes.

## Coverage

Partial coverage data:
- Unable to generate full coverage due to test failures
- Will re-run after fixing imports

## Next Steps

1. Fix import errors by updating test files
2. Move runtime code into test functions
3. Add missing pytest markers
4. Re-run full test suite
5. Capture performance metrics and accuracy

## Test Categories Status

| Category | Status | Tests | Issues |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Core | ❌ | Created | Import errors |
| Retrieval | ❌ | Created | FusionScorer import |
| DOM | ⚠️ | Partial | Some work |
| SPA | ⚠️ | Partial | Not fully tested |
| Resilience | ⚠️ | Partial | Not fully tested |
| Performance | ❌ | Created | Benchmark marker missing |
| Forms | ✅ | Exists | Some pass |
| Auth | ⚠️ | Partial | Not fully tested |
| i18n | ❌ | Missing | Not created |
| CLI | ❌ | Exists | Import errors |
| Robustness | ⚠️ | Partial | Not fully tested |

## Raw Output Sample

```
ERROR collecting tests/retrieval/test_nlp_scoring.py
ImportError: cannot import name 'FusionScorer' from 'her.rank.fusion'

ERROR collecting tests/test_all_fixes.py
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'element'

Tests that work:
tests/test_basic.py::test_imports PASSED
tests/test_basic.py::test_basic_math PASSED
tests/test_descriptors.py - 6 tests PASSED
```

## Conclusion

The test suite needs significant fixes to run properly after reorganization. Main issues are:
1. Import paths need updating
2. Runtime code needs to be moved into functions
3. Missing test configurations

Will proceed with fixes in SELFCRITIQUE_PASS_1.md
