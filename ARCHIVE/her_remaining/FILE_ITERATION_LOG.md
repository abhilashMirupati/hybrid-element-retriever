## Import Safety Verification

### Checked Imports

✅ All files compile with `python -m compileall src/`
✅ No circular import dependencies detected
✅ All imports use absolute paths within src/her
✅ External dependencies properly declared in requirements.txt

### Import Chain

```
CLI → CLI_API → [
    Session → Snapshot
    QueryEmbedder → Resolver
    ElementEmbedder → Resolver
    VectorCache
    FusionRanker
    Synthesizer
    Verifier
    Executor → Verifier
    SelfHealer → Synthesizer, Verifier
    Promotion
]
```

### Contract Updates

All public contracts maintained:
- HybridClient.query() returns QueryResult with strict JSON
- HybridClient.act() returns ActionResult with waits and post_action
- All components handle None/empty inputs gracefully
- Fallback mechanisms in place for all components

## Summary Statistics
