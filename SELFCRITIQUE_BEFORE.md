## Import Graph Risks

### Circular Dependencies
- None detected

### Missing Imports
- Some test files import modules that may not exist
- Java wrapper imports need validation

### Heavy Dependencies
- Playwright (required but heavy)
- ONNX Runtime (ML requirement)
- Transformers (for model export only)

## File Cleanup Candidates

### Delete These Files
- `.github/workflows/ci-simple.yml` - redundant
- `TODO_LIST.md` - development artifact
- `TODO_PLAN.md` - development artifact  
- `MERGE_READY.md` - premature
- `PR_MERGE_CHECKLIST.md` - development artifact
- `CI_README.md` - redundant with main README

### Keep But Update
- `README.md` - needs production focus
- `CHANGELOG.md` - needs proper versioning
- `RISKS.md` - needs mitigation updates

## Critical Missing Features

1. **Occlusion Detection**: No elementFromPoint validation
2. **Overlay Handling**: No auto-dismiss for popups/banners
3. **Shadow DOM**: Not using pierce parameter
4. **Promotion Storage**: No SQLite persistence
5. **Cache Persistence**: Only in-memory cache
6. **SPA Support**: No route change detection
7. **Coverage Gate**: No pytest-cov configuration
8. **Build Artifacts**: No CI artifact upload

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Implement getFlattenedDocument with pierce=true
2. Add occlusion guard with elementFromPoint
3. Implement overlay detection and dismissal
4. Add SQLite cache and promotion storage
5. Configure pytest-cov with 80% gate
6. Fix CI to upload artifacts
7. Implement SPA route tracking
8. Add proper LRU cache with SQLite

### Code Quality Improvements
1. Run black formatter on entire codebase
2. Fix all flake8 violations
3. Add complete type hints
4. Remove all placeholder code
5. Implement all TODO items
6. Add missing test cases

### Documentation Updates
1. Rewrite README for production use
2. Remove development artifacts
3. Update CHANGELOG with versions
4. Document troubleshooting steps

## Conclusion

The project has a good foundation but needs significant work to meet production requirements. Main gaps are in robustness features (occlusion, overlays), persistence (SQLite), and CI/CD completeness. With focused implementation of missing features and cleanup of development artifacts, the project can reach production-ready status.
